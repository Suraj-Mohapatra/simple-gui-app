I would like to express my sincere gratitude towards Johann N. LÃ¶flmann for creating Jarfix.
This simple yet powerful tool has been immensely helpful in resolving .jar file association issues on Windows.
Your contribution to the community is undeniably valuable and deeply appreciated.

clone the project  
cd simple-fx-app  
mvn clean package exec:java

or, run the build jar as below,  
java -jar simple-fx-app.jar  
or, javaw -jar simple-fx-app.jar

best way, download the jarfix tool and run it as an administrator. Boom, now you can double click on the jar to run.
